# code-commit
A minimalist share pad with no backend. Thus can be hosted on Github Pages.

It uses http://JSONStorage.net as a json storage service and thus does not require any backend for data storage.
Just change the `uniqueID` in `scr/script.js` to your uniqueID and have fun!

## Why Code-Commit
It is a minimalist code share platform developed to help students
share code between a test!

Yes you read that right. Being a minimalist version the code sharing can be done easily and faster
than other platforms. This will be incorporated in to http://itians.xyz soon.

### Best Part
It can be hosted on static page hosting services like Github Pages.
